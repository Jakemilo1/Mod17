## Summary

In this tutorial, we will be discussing Regular Expressions, also known as regex. Regular expressions are a very powerful tool for manipulating text and data. They are used in programming languages for "pattern matching" - the process of finding and replacing certain patterns in strings. We will be exploring different components of a regular expression and explain how they work using Python as our primary language. Here's an example of a regular expression:

```python
import re
pattern = r"^[a-z]+\d*$"
matched_string = re.match(pattern, "abc123")
```

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors in a regular expression are used to specify the position of the pattern in the string.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers are used to specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found.

### OR Operator
The OR operator allows for the matching of either the expression before or the expression after the operator.

### Character Classes
Character classes allow for the matching of any character from a certain set.

### Flags
Flags are used to control the behavior of the regular expression.

### Grouping and Capturing
Grouping allows us to combine several characters as a single unit or group. Capturing, on the other hand, allows us to match the group but also remember the text that was matched.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions are used to specify a character class.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
The greedy method for a regular expression tries to match as much as possible. The lazy method, on the other hand, tries to match as little as possible.

### Boundaries
Boundaries are used to define the boundaries between words.

### Back-references
Backreferences in a pattern allow you to specify that the contents of an earlier capturing group must also be found at the current location in the string.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Lookahead and lookbehind, collectively called "lookaround", are zero-length assertions just like the start and end of line, and start and end of word anchors explained earlier in this tutorial.
